## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and get started with FullGuide:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (version 16 or higher) - Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
    *   npm (Node Package Manager) - Usually included with Node.js
    *   A code editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom)

2.  **Create a new project directory:**

    ```bash
    mkdir fullguide-agent
    cd fullguide-agent
    ```

3.  **Initialize a new Node.js project:**

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```

4.  **Install required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install openai dotenv  # Example dependencies, adjust as needed
    ```

5.  **Create a `.env` file:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your OpenAI API key (or any other API keys you'll be using):

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
    ```

    **Important:**  Never commit your `.env` file to version control!  Add it to your `.gitignore` file.

6.  **Create your main application file (e.g., `index.js`):**

    ```bash
    touch index.js
    ```

## Usage Examples üí°

Here are a few examples to get you started.  These examples assume you have a basic understanding of Node.js and JavaScript.

**Example 1:  A Simple Greeting Agent**

```javascript
// index.js
require('dotenv').config();
const { OpenAI } = require("openai");

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

async function main() {
  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant." }, { role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
}

main();
```

Run this example:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will print a friendly greeting from the AI agent.

**Example 2:  An Agent with a Tool (Simple Calculator)**

```javascript
// index.js
require('dotenv').config();
const { OpenAI } = require("openai");

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

// Define a simple calculator tool
async function calculate(expression) {
  try {
    // WARNING:  Using eval() is generally unsafe.  For production, use a safer alternative like math.js.
    const result = eval(expression);
    return `The result of ${expression} is ${result}`;
  } catch (error) {
    return `Error: Invalid expression.`;
  }
}

async function main() {
  const prompt = "What is 2 + 2?";

  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "You are an assistant that can use a calculator tool.  If the user asks a question that requires calculation, use the 'calculate' tool." },
      { role: "user", content: prompt },
    ],
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    functions: [
      {
        name: "calculate",
        description: "Calculates a mathematical expression.",
        parameters: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            expression: {
              type: "string",
              description: "The mathematical expression to calculate (e.g., '2 + 2', '3 * 5').",
            },
          },
          required: ["expression"],
        },
      },
    ],
    function_call: "auto", // Let OpenAI decide when to use the function
  });

  const responseMessage = completion.choices[0].message;

  if (responseMessage.function_call) {
    const functionName = responseMessage.function_call.name;
    const functionArgs = JSON.parse(responseMessage.function_call.arguments);

    if (functionName === "calculate") {
      const calculationResult = await calculate(functionArgs.expression);

      const secondResponse = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        messages: [
          { role: "system", content: "You are an assistant that can use a calculator tool.  If the user asks a question that requires calculation, use the 'calculate' tool." },
          { role: "user", content: prompt },
          responseMessage, // The initial response from OpenAI
          { role: "function", name: "calculate", content: calculationResult }, // The result from the tool
        ],
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      });

      console.log(secondResponse.choices[0].message.content);
    }
  } else {
    console.log(responseMessage.content);
  }
}

main();
```

This example demonstrates how to define a tool (a simple calculator) and how to have the AI agent call that tool when appropriate.  Remember to replace the `eval()` function with a safer alternative for production use.

## API Documentation üìö

This guide primarily focuses on using the OpenAI API.  Refer to the official OpenAI API documentation for detailed information on available endpoints, parameters, and response formats:

*   [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)

We will provide specific examples and guidance on how to use the OpenAI API within the context of building AI agents.  We will also cover other relevant APIs as needed for specific tool integrations.
