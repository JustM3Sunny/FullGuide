## Full Guide: Building AI Agents in Node.js - Step-by-Step üöÄ

This section provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building AI agents in Node.js. We'll cover everything from initial setup to advanced tool integration and calling. We will explore various Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and Llama, providing specific instructions and code examples for each.

### 1. Project Setup and Initialization ‚öôÔ∏è

As detailed in the Installation section, setting up your project correctly is crucial. Let's reiterate and expand on those steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (v18+) and npm installed.  Verify with `node -v` and `npm -v`. Node 18 or higher is recommended for better support of modern JavaScript features and potential compatibility with newer LLM libraries.

2.  **Create Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    mkdir my-ai-agent
    cd my-ai-agent
    ```

3.  **Initialize npm Project:**

    ```bash
    npm init -y
    ```
    This creates a `package.json` file with default settings.  You can customize this later, adding scripts for running and testing your agent.

4.  **Install Core Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install openai dotenv axios  # axios for making HTTP requests to external tools
    ```
    *   `openai`:  The official OpenAI Node.js library.
    *   `dotenv`:  For managing environment variables (API keys).
    *   `axios`: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to external tools.

    For Gemini, Claude, and Llama, you'll need to install their respective SDKs or libraries.  Examples:

    ```bash
    # Placeholder - Replace with actual Gemini/Claude/Llama libraries if available
    # npm install @google-cloud/ai-platform  # Example for Gemini (may require further setup)
    # npm install anthropic  # Example for Claude
    # npm install llama  # Example for Llama (likely requires specific bindings)
    ```

    **Note:**  The specific installation process for Gemini, Claude, and Llama will depend on the available Node.js libraries and APIs.  Refer to their official documentation for the most up-to-date instructions.  Some models might require Docker or other specialized environments.

5.  **`.env` File Configuration:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY  # If using Gemini
    CLAUDE_API_KEY=YOUR_CLAUDE_API_KEY  # If using Claude
    # No API key needed for Llama if running locally
    ```

    **CRITICAL:** Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits of your API key.  This is a crucial security step.

6.  **`index.js` - Your Agent's Brain:**

    Create the main application file:

    ```bash
    touch index.js
    ```

### 2. Core Agent Implementation: Basic Conversation üí¨

Let's start with a simple agent that can hold a basic conversation.  We'll demonstrate this with OpenAI, and then provide guidance on adapting it for other LLMs.
