## 1. Introduction to AI Agents

AI agents are autonomous entities that perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of Node.js, these agents are typically implemented as software programs that interact with external APIs, databases, and other systems.  A well-designed AI agent should be able to:

*   Understand user input (natural language).
*   Reason about the user's request.
*   Plan a sequence of actions to fulfill the request.
*   Execute those actions using available tools.
*   Learn from its experiences and improve over time.

## 2. Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher is recommended.  Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm (Node Package Manager):**  Typically installed with Node.js.
*   **A Code Editor:** VS Code, Sublime Text, or your preferred editor.

Create a new project directory and initialize a Node.js project:
