/**
 * This module exports a collection of tools that can be used by other parts of the application.
 * Currently, it includes a calculator and a search tool.
 *
 * To add a new tool:
 * 1. Create a new file for the tool in the same directory (e.g., 'myNewTool.js').
 * 2. Implement the tool's functionality in that file.
 * 3. Require the tool in this file (e.g., `const myNewTool = require('./myNewTool');`).
 * 4. Add the tool to the module.exports object (e.g., `myNewTool`).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * // myNewTool.js
 * module.exports = {
 *   doSomething: (input) => {
 *     // Implement the tool's logic here
 *     return `Result of doing something with ${input}`;
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * // index.js (this file)
 * const calculator = require('./calculator');
 * const search = require('./search');
 * const myNewTool = require('./myNewTool');
 *
 * module.exports = {
 *   calculator,
 *   search,
 *   myNewTool,
 * };
 *
 *
 * Tool Calling System:
 *
 * The tools exported here are designed to be called by a central orchestration system.
 * This system is responsible for determining which tool to use based on the user's input or the current task.
 *
 * The orchestration system should:
 * 1. Receive user input or a task description.
 * 2. Analyze the input to determine which tool is most appropriate.
 * 3. Call the selected tool with the necessary parameters.
 * 4. Process the tool's output and return it to the user or use it for further processing.
 *
 * Each tool should be designed to be modular and reusable, with a clear and well-defined interface.
 * This allows the orchestration system to easily call and integrate different tools as needed.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 *
 * Each tool should handle its own errors gracefully and return informative error messages to the orchestration system.
 * The orchestration system should then handle these errors appropriately, such as by logging them or displaying them to the user.
 *
 * Input Validation:
 *
 * Each tool should validate its input parameters to ensure that they are valid and within the expected range.
 * This helps to prevent errors and ensures that the tool functions correctly.
 *
 * Logging:
 *
 * Each tool should log important events, such as when it is called, what input parameters it receives, and what output it returns.
 * This helps to debug the tool and track its usage.
